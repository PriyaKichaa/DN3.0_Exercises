Exercise 7: Implementing the Observer Pattern
=====================================================
Scenario: 
You are developing a stock market monitoring application where multiple clients need to be notified whenever stock prices change. 
Use the Observer Pattern to achieve this.

Steps:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
        - Create a new Java project named ObserverPatternExample.
2.	Define Subject Interface:
        - Create an interface Stock with methods to register, deregister, and notify observers.
3.	Implement Concrete Subject:
        - Create a class StockMarket that implements Stock and maintains a list of observers.
4.	Define Observer Interface:
        - Create an interface Observer with a method update().
5.	Implement Concrete Observers:
        - Create classes MobileApp, WebApp that implement Observer.
6.	Test the Observer Implementation:
        - Create a test class to demonstrate the registration and notification of observers.
