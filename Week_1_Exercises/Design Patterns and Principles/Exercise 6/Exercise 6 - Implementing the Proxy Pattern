Exercise 6: Implementing the Proxy Pattern
=====================================================
Scenario: 
You are developing an image viewer application that loads images from a remote server. 
Use the Proxy Pattern to add lazy initialization and caching.

Steps:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
        - Create a new Java project named ProxyPatternExample.
2.	Define Subject Interface:
        - Create an interface Image with a method display().
3.	Implement Real Subject Class:
        - Create a class RealImage that implements Image and loads an image from a remote server.
4.	Implement Proxy Class:
        - Create a class ProxyImage that implements Image and holds a reference to RealImage.
        - Implement lazy initialization and caching in ProxyImage.
5.	Test the Proxy Implementation:
        - Create a test class to demonstrate the use of ProxyImage to load and display images.
